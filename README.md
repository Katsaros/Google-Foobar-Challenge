# Google FooBar Challenge
I participate in Google FooBar Challenge and I completed all the 5 levels.

### What is Foobar Challenge?
Google Foobar is Google’s secret hiring challenge.<br>
Google uses this to hire some of the best developers around the globe which they think can be a good match for their organization.<br>
Once you accept the invite, you will be taken to a website in which you are given a question and a time limit and you have to finish the question within the limit or you fail.<br><br>
If you are able to solve the problem, you can request a new one and eventually move on to higher levels.<br>
But if you fail to complete a question, then you will no longer be able to request new problems.<br><br>
After you request for the challenge you will we having some files and the question to solve.<br>
The question can be solved in either in JAVA or Python.<br>
In total, you have **5 levels** and **9 questions** to solve.

### My Experience with the Google FooBar Challenge
The Google Foobar page is not accessible to everyone.<br>
Getting the invitation for Google Foobar is also a mysterious thing, no one exactly knows the criteria for the Google Foobar invitation eligibility.<br>
Google send the invitation on the basis of your search history and your problem solving related keyword searches.<br>
And based on Google search algorithms, they show you an invitation for Google Foobar.<br>

The invitation message reads like this:<br>***Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one from Google?***

## Invitation

## Development
- All the solutions developed in Java 8+ by verifying and submitting the given file Solution.java, in every Foobar level/problem.
- The decryption script developed in Python, using "giannis.katsaros" as secret key for the base64 string.

## More about the questions
The challenge had 5 levels, with each level having questions related to graphs and maths.

**Level 1**<br>
The first level was very similar to an interview question. 
You get 2 days to do it. I completed it quickly.

**Level 2**<br>
There are two questions at this stage with the time of seventy-two hours to solve each question. 
Both the questions were based on the basic principles of linear algebra and mathematics.

**Level 3**<br>
The third level had 3 questions, with a time of 4 days for the first question and 7 days for the other two question.
To solve these questions, it required a good knowledge of mathematics and programming concepts like dynamic programming, Markov’s chaining, etc.
After the 3rd level, I was asked to fill out my details for being contacted by a Google recruiter.
They ask your basic information: name, phone number, email address, country etc.

**Level 4**<br>
There are a total of two questions at this level and time of a total of two weeks is given to solve each question.
This level required the implementation of several concepts to solve a single problem. 
Extensive knowledge of algorithms and data structures is required at this level.
The questions were based on the concept of number theory and graphs.

**Level 5**<br>
The final level only had a single question and twenty-two days were given to solve that problem, but I managed to solve it in 22 **hours**.
The fifth level was purely mathematical. 
It was related to permutations, Beatty sequence, and the development of an implementation of exponentially decreasing complexity.

***With the submission of this question, the Google Foobar Challenge is completed!***

# Conclusion
I would say this is a great opportunity to learn and I would recommend you to solve the questions if you get an invitation.<br>
While solving the problems don’t keep your aim to get hired at Google but to learn the new techniques and experience one of the best coding challenges. And remember, 
**Foobar is more about learning and implementing, instead of knowing everything before!**<br><br>
